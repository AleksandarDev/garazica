# Lease protection

- Leaser or buyer is required to scan QR code from other side to confirm item was leased
- When item is returned same process is required

If item was not returned and dispute was opened, we can determine which side was damaged.

User which did the damage will receive [reputation](Reputation-system#penalties) penalty or be permanently banned.
